<b style="text-align:right;margin-top:50px;">Embarking on a transformative journey spanning four decades, <a href="https://mvjce.edu.in/"target="_blank">MVJ College of Engineering</a> has evolved into a dynamic hub of learning, blending technical prowess with character development.
The goal of MVJCE has been to create efficient programmes that allow students to be carefully transformed into highly motivated graduates and postgraduates, enriched with professional competence, managerial skills, inherent dynamism and humanism, and industry ready. The curriculum is revamped based on the recommendations of NEP 2020, AICTE (Model Curriculum), UGC, VTU as well as National, Societal & industry requirements.The College is approved by AICTE – New Delhi, affiliated to VTU – Belagavi and recognized by UGC with 2(f) & 12(B) status. MVJCE has come a long way since its modest beginnings. Today, it is ranked among the front-line Engineering Colleges in Karnataka. The secret for this achievement is that it has evolved constantly, keeping pace with changing times and technologies. Notably, the College was conferred with Autonomous Status from the Academic year 2019-20.

The Institute initially started with undergraduate programmes in four disciplines in 1982, with a modest intake of 200. Subsequently, the Institute got approval for more programmes over different academic years, and has grown by leaps and bounds in the last 42 years. We currently offer 15 undergraduate Programmes, 8 Postgraduate Programmes and Ph D under 8 Programmes/research centres. We are permanently affiliated to Visvesvaraya Technological University (VTU), and approved by the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE).</b>
